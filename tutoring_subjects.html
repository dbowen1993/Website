    <h1>Tutoring Subjects</h1>
    <section class="mathborder">
        <p><strong>Mathematics</strong> 
        is a subject that we cover throughout the grade levels and into the college and university levels.
        In terms of basic math, we can support you or your child from kindergarten through grade 12.
        We can assist you in algebra, whether it be introductory algebra or pre-calculus.
        If you have concerns about calculus, we cover introductory calculus at the high school level as well
        as calculus I and calculus II. For statistics, we can support you in the statistics courses
        that are offered in a wide variety of programs at colleges and universities. </p>
    </section>
    <section class="economicsborder">
        <p><strong>Economics</strong> is generally taught at higher levels of education, and it is broadly divided
        between macroeconomics and microeconomics. Between the two, microeconomics is considered to be more mathematically
        intensive and concrete, while macroeconomics focuses more heavily on theoretical knowledge and comprehension. Whether
        you struggle with one or the other, or both, we can help to ensure your success by identifying your strengths and
        bolstering your weaknesses in the aforementioned subcategories.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="englishborder">
        <p><strong>English Language Arts</strong>, like any language, can be difficult for somebody learning it as a second language.
        We have recognized the increasing demand for second language education in English. We have a tutor with pedagogical
        training in teaching phonetics and the syntax of the English language. When it comes to English as a first language,
        assistance is readily available for you or your child at any grade level and into the college and university levels.
        Advanced essay writing in particular is a vital skill for all students in higher education, regardless of their chosen
        discipline.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="testpreparationborder">
